Like the three most recent presidents of the United States, Gary Johnson has admitted to using marijuana. Governor Johnson first began using it medicinally as an alternative to more dangerous and addictive opioid painkillers after he shattered a vertebrae in a rock climbing accident. Marijuana is in fact less dangerous, to users and those around the users than is Alcohol or tobacco, both of which are legal drugs. However, Governor Johnson is aware of the need for a president who is ready at any time. He has not drank alcohol in 29 years, and doesn't intend to consume marijuana during this election or as president.
