title: ...isn't he in favor of free trade?

Yes. Governor Johnson believes, and 90% of economists agree that free trade benefits Americans. What many free trade deals fail to do is ensure worker protections, and many end up benefitting large corporations the most. Governor Johnson wants to ensure that free trade succeed at benefiting all americans, and not just the richest.
