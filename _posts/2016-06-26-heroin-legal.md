title: ...doesn't he want to make heroin legal?
---

Gary Johnson is not advocating the legalization of heroin, but is instead in favor of decriminalizing the use of heroin and treating heroin addiction as a public health issue instead of a criminal justice issue. Governor Johnson has also stated interest in allowing states to implement harm reduction policies such as needle exchanges, drug testing, or even supervised injection sites like those set up in Zurich and Vancouver. These harm reduction policies are proven to reduce drug related crimes, reduce the number of deaths and injuries resulting from drug use, and reduce the number of addicts injecting in public. We are in the midst of a opioid epidemic that is killing thousands. It might seem odd to advocate for a policy such as this, but our current approach of simply arresting those addicted to drugs has been ineffective, so maybe it is time to use another tested approach, with a proven track record.
