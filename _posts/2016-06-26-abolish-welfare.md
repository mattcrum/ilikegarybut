No, Governor Johnson believes that the government does have a role in making sure we are protected from extreme poverty. He does however want to save money for the taxpayers in three ways. First, he wants to make our social safety net more efficient by eliminating the wasteful aspects of the system. For example, for every one dollar spent by the government to fight medicaid fraud, we have made back seven dollars and seventy cents. Second, beyond eliminating waste, he wants to make social security more secure by increasing the retirement rate of todayâ€™s young people, who are projected to be the longest lived generation ever. Finally, he wants to make social security, our national pension fund optional, so that those citizens who would rather invest their money themselves can take that risk for themselves.
