title: ...does he even have any experience?
---

Yes! Johnson served as a republican for eight years as the Governor of New Mexico, a blue state. As governor, he balanced the budget, cut taxes, reduced the wasteful spending, while building schools and roads, and being reelected in a landslide. William Weld, his running mate also served as a two term Republican governor of a blue state who was reelected in a landslide. Together, the two have more executive experience than the candidates from any other party.
