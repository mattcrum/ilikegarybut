Yes, Gary Johnson is the only third party candidate who will be on the ballot in all fifty states. In addition, He and his running mate both have more executive experience actually leading a government than do either of their opponents. Speaking of their opponents, this election is the best one for a third party candidate. With both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton receiving negative approval ratings, and a considerable portion of both of their parties opposed to their presumptive nominees. Compared to the scandals and controversies in their past, and the ongoing investigations, Gary Johnson seems rather electable in comparison.
