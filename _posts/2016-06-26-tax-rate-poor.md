title: ...won’t he make everybody, even the poor, pay the same tax rate?

No, Gary Johnson supports a tax plan that would look like the FairTax. The FairTax eliminates all forms of taxation on businesses, investments, and income, and replaces them all with a flat sales tax. This method of taxation will greatly reduced the costs to businesses and individuals in ensuring that taxes are paid. Nobody under the Fairtax would have to fill out IRS forms, and no businesses would be able to negotiate tax loopholes. Since the Fairtax taxes consumption, it means that those who are wealthy and consume more will pay more. Additionally, to ensure that the poorest citizens who currently don’t pay any taxes, will not have a new tax burden, every American family will receive a check at the beginning of the month that will offset all tax costs up to the poverty level. For example, a family of four, with two adults and two children, will receive a check for approximately $600 every month to offset tax costs up to the poverty level. This is the closest thing to a basic income that any candidate has proposed.
